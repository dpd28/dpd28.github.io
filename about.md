Hi!

I’m Deb Pang Davis, a designer and lifelong learner.

Right now, my home is in Miami, Florida where I’m studying AI, AR, data visualization, UX research, Human-centered Design, and GIS (Geographic Information Systems). It’s cupcake.

If you have an interest, check out the [MFA in Interactive Media at the University of Miami](https://interactive.miami.edu). Trust me, you don’t have to be a designer to apply. 

Learn more about me and [see my design portfolio](https://www.deb.is) »
